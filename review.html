<hr>

<pre>This week I received a copy of a new book abouit C programming.
It is suitable for people who have had at least one semester of
instruction in C.

	<strong>C Interfaces and Implementations</strong>
	Techniques for Creating Reusable Software
	David R. Hanson
	Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series
	ISBN 0-201-49841-3

There are a number of small slips, like spelling &quot;disseminate&quot; as
&quot;disemminate&quot; on the first page of the Preface and spelling &quot;incidentally&quot;
as &quot;incidently&quot; on p193.

There are a lot of things I wouldn't do that way.
A number of things (like external identifiers that are not distinct
in the first 6 letters) are non-standard.
Quite a lot of things are perfectly splendid C, but will choke a C++
compiler.  (You thought C++ was a superset of C?  You were wrong.)
But it's a book about C, not C++.

However, if more C programmers read, understood, and imitated this book,
the world would be a better and safer place.  If you liked &quot;Code Complete&quot;,
you'll probably like this book.

David Hanson and Christopher Fraser wrote &quot;<a
href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/">A Retargetable C Compiler:
Design and Implementation</a>&quot;, which describes lcc, a compiler I am very
pleased to have.  David Hanson is a very good programmer, and most of
us will learn something useful from this book.
